//1. What is the purpose of array?
 /**
  * In JavaScript, array is a single variable that is used to store different elements. It is often used when we 
  * want to store list of elements and access them by a single variable. Unlike most languages where array is a 
  * reference to the multiple variable, in JavaScript array is a single variable that stores multiple elements.
    
    Declaration of an Array 
    There are basically two ways to declare an array. 
    Example: 
            var House = [ ]; // method 1 
            var House = new Array(); // method 2 
        But generally method 1 is preferred over the method 2. Let us understand the reason for this.

//3. Number of elements in an array
 /**
  * var variableName = [elements];
  */


// 4. What is index?
 /**
  * The 'index' is the postion of the values in an array.
  * 
  * The indexOf() method returns the first index (position) of a specified value.

    The indexOf() method returns -1 if the value is not found.

    The indexOf() method starts at a specified index and searches from left to right.

    By default the search starts at the first element and ends at the last.

    Negative start values counts from the last element (but still searches from left to right).

//5. Find the value of an element by index
 /**
  * The indexOf() method returns the position of a specified value or element.
  */
  var fruits = [ 'apple', 'banana', 'orange', 'watermelon'];
  var index = fruits.indexOf('watermelon')
    console.log(index);
